# Writing Task #4
## Question #1 
This project is a fake website that me and my group made. 
I worked on the our company info page,and more specifically 
the following files: about.html, about.css and about-reset.css.
## Question #2
As we were finishing up the first part of this Software developer course,
we were told that our final project would be to create a website with 3 or
more pages for a fake company. Me and my group descided to create a website 
about a company called "Mercury Media", a space company founded by astronauts
that sells you stars and constellations and even create custom ones of your own.
## Question #3
While I was making the info page I was thinking about the information and how the
information and the photos to use. I had to order the information in a way that made
sense so that it started with info about the company and it's origins, followed by 
a section detailing the types of packages and services we offer and ended with a
section that fills like a conclusion with an added hook that leads you straight into
the contact page.
